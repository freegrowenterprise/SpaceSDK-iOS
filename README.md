# üì° SpaceSDK-iOS

**SpaceSDK** is a UWB-based iOS SDK developed by **FREEGROW Inc.**, providing features such as distance measurement, direction detection, and real-time RTLS (location estimation).  
With a single class `GrowSpaceSDK`, developers can easily access UWB capabilities without dealing with low-level complexities.

## üß± Initialization

```swift
let growSpaceSDK = GrowSpaceSDK()
```

---

## üöÄ Start Ranging
```swift
growSpaceSDK.startUWBRanging(
    maximumConnectionCount: 4,
    replacementDistanceThreshold: 8,
    uwbUpdateTimeoutSeconds: 5,
    onUpdate: { result in
        let name = result.deviceName
        let distance = result.distance
        let azimuth = result.azimuth
        let elevation = result.elevation

        DispatchQueue.main.async {
            // Display result on UI
            updateDeviceUI(
                name: name,
                distance: distance,
                azimuth: azimuth,
                elevation: elevation
            )
        }
    },
    onDisconnect: { result in
        DispatchQueue.main.async {
            removeDeviceUI(name: result.deviceName)
        }
    }
)
```

---

## üõë Stop Ranging

```swift
growSpaceSDK.stopUWBRanging {
    print("‚úÖ Ranging stopped")
}
```

---


## üìç RTLS Location Estimation
```swift
growSpaceSDK.startUWBRanging(
    onUpdate: { result in
        // Store distance results
        anchorResults[result.deviceName] = result

        // Convert to anchor data with known coordinates
        let anchors = convertToAnchorResults(
            from: anchorResults,
            coordinates: anchorCoordinateMap
        )

        // RTLS location processing
        growSpaceRTLS.startUwbRtls(
            anchors: anchors,
            onResult: { location in
                DispatchQueue.main.async {
                    // Update user's position on grid
                    updateUserPositionOnGrid(CGPoint(x: location.x, y: location.y))
                }
            }
        )
    }
)
```
